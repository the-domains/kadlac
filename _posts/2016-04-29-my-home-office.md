# My Home Office

My home office Since the move, the new room that I'm working in happens to also be our living room. The desk that I sit at is oak with a parsons like steel frame built by a college student. The window shades are shut at night, but if you were to pull the cord, it would reveal some brush, only viewed through jail like bars.
